# 📝 TaskMaster – Persistent Todo List

TaskMaster is a simple yet powerful **ToDo List application** built with **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**.  
It uses the browser’s **Local Storage** to persist tasks, ensuring that no data is lost when the page is refreshed.

This project was designed to demonstrate **state management**, **DOM manipulation**, and **data persistence** without using any backend, database, or external API.
